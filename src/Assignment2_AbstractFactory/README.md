In this example, we have two styles (A and B) for each UI element (Button, TextField, Checkbox) 
implemented using the Abstract Factory design pattern. The setText() method is common to all UI
elements and is defined in the abstract class. When you run the Main class, it demonstrates the 
creation and display of UI elements in Style A, and changing the text dynamically.
